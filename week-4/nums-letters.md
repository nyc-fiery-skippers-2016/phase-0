##What is an integer? What is a float?

An integer is a whole number, a float is a decimal number.

##What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

Integer division, you can get a non-exact number, that is you don't get a leftover value; so 9 divided by 4 is 2. If you have 20 bucks and beers cost $6, you can buy 3 beers. Float division uses decimal values and is good for physics and other high-level math calculations.
