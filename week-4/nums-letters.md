##What does puts do?

Prints on the screen whatever comes after it, and returns nil.

##What is an integer? What is a float?

An integer is a whole number, a float is a decimal number.

##What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

Integer division, you can get a non-exact number, that is you don't get a leftover value; so 9 divided by 4 is 2. If you have 20 bucks and beers cost $6, you can buy 3 beers. Float division uses decimal values and is good for physics and other high-level math calculations.

###hours in a year: 
```
puts 365 * 24
```

###minutes in a decade:

```

* What are strings? Why and when would you use them?

Strings are groups of letters in a program.

* What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?

A variable stores a string or number in your computer's memory. This allows you to save them and use them later in your program.

* How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?
