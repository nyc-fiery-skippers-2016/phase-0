# DRIVER CODE
 # initialize VirusPredictor for each state


# alabama = VirusPredictor.new("Alabama", STATE_DATA["Alabama"][:population_density], STATE_DATA["Alabama"][:population])
# alabama.virus_effects

# jersey = VirusPredictor.new("New Jersey", STATE_DATA["New Jersey"][:population_density], STATE_DATA["New Jersey"][:population])
# jersey.virus_effects

# california = VirusPredictor.new("California", STATE_DATA["California"][:population_density], STATE_DATA["California"][:population])
# california.virus_effects

# alaska = VirusPredictor.new("Alaska", STATE_DATA["Alaska"][:population_density], STATE_DATA["Alaska"][:population])
# alaska.virus_effects

STATE_DATA.each do |state, info|
  state = VirusPredictor.new(state, info[:population_density], info[:population])
state.virus_effects
end


#=======================================================================
# Reflection Section

# What are the differences between the two different hash syntaxes shown in the state_data file?
# => can be used for strings as keys whereas, : makes the key a symbol.

# What does require_relative do? How is it different from require?
# require_relative finds a file within the local directory, require finds through Ruby source directories.

# What are some ways to iterate through a hash?
# We used each for this challenge, using state and info as parameters

# When refactoring virus_effects, what stood out to you about the variables, if anything?
# repeated variables and expressions

# What concept did you most solidify in this challenge?
# using private in a class, combining strings across methods. iterating through a hashy-hash.
