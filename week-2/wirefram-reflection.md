What is a wireframe? What are the benefits of wireframing?

A wireframe is a design tool for designers and developers to help them define the hierarchy of information in a website, which in turn makes it easier for them to plan the layout and develop the visual feel and functionality of the site.

Did you enjoy wireframing your site?

This has been my favorite activity thus far. Though my wireframes may look crude and dashed off, I'm working with some ideas that I've been thinking about in terms of web design: using the language of fine art (Mondrian), crafts (origame), and storytelling (childrens' books like Journey, Quest, and The Book With No Pictures).

Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?

I made my wireframes extremely simple, which I hope will allow me to build them out and play with the basic ideas. I have no HTML/CSS knowledge so I'm trying to stick to boxes and lines. In the info I'm wanting to convey, I feel like there's very little heirarchy. Each element is just as important as the other. The reason I want to use two pictures of myself is because I think there shouldn't be one photo of one person; in a weird way I think it counterbalances the emphasis you otherwise put on The Face photo. The center box is blank. That may change but, again, I want to keep the idea of no heirarchy in play, sort of like a circle. If the blank center weighs too much I might blend some of the boxes or use a neutral color to keep it from being distracting.

What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?

I want to make this fun, playful, interesting to me. I'm the customer, so to speak. So, as I mentioned above, the first thing I did was to google "Mondrian" and downloaded some images for inspiration. I created an ideaBox in my phase-0 repo. Sort of like a shoebox that I can dump ideas into. Visual ideas for this challenge, and other projects.

Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?

Like I said, I've enjoyed this challenge the most. I enjoyed the brainstorming part most. I enjoyed sketching out a wireframe. I found it tedious to look for a wireframing program, and though I'd like to familiarize myself with this landscape, my gut told me to stick with sketching. I plan to do this for at least a little while, since this engages my enjoyment of drawing, doodling, and writing stuff out by hand, as well as helps me think.
