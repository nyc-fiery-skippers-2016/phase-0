What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?
Information gathering, Planning, Design, Development, Testing & Delivery, Maintenance

What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?
This is my professional website. It shows my work history, background, interests, and past projects I've worked on. In addition it provides basic info like contact info and links to LinkedIn and GitHub.

What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
Potential employers and fellow coders. Anyone connected to networks that I'm connected to, with shared working interests, and even aesthetic tastes.

What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.
I want them to see my portfolio as well as know my backstory. I come from publishing, I'm creative, I have an eye for detail and a sense for what looks and feels right. I want people to see what I'm working on and how to contact me if they think it's interesting. Looking employable is important but I'm trying to look beyond that.

What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?
User experience is about how a person feels when he/she's interacting with a website, app, software, etc. It's important to keep in mind the usability of the system, its design, how its used, how accessible it is, and the overall system performance, as well as its marketability.

What is user experience design and why is it valuable?
User experience design focuses on the user. It's not just about making cool stuff and impressing a client. Design that's user-friendly, literally. UX is valuable because it ensures things can be accessed in myriad ways by people with physical and/or environmental limitations. It takes into account users with limited access to broadband, using outdated mobile devices, etc. UX helps keep the world-wide web more wordly, and broadens markets.

Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
Uploading the photo of my site-map to my computer. I couldn't get my Airdrop to work, and still not sure why! Also, I'm having a hard time at the moment figuring out how to get this thing to git.
