How was your experience translating a wireframe into HTML?

More challenging than I had expected, timewise. I found myself spending more time with the images than I'd anticipated and in retrospect it would have better to think of them as placeholders, and spending more time on filling in the text, and creating links within the text. Overall though, I think I have an okay wireframe to go by.

What new tricks or elements did you learn about in HTML?

Two things. If you wrap an image in "mailto" tags you create a cool click-on-me button. I wrote email me! on a piece of paper and made that my img. Second, I discovered you can put a title= in your img wrap, so that when a user hovers over an image words magically appear.

Are you excited to start incorporating the design you chose next week?

I think so. Definitely. But also nervous, because I know it's going to be frustrating and complicated compared to plain-old html wires.
