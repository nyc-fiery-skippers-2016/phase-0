- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
It was gratifying seeing the work displayed on a web page, even though rudimentory looking. At first it was tricky navigating among GitHub, my local folders, and online. But I got the hang of it somewhat.
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
HTML elements come a lot more intuitively to me than writing programs. Probably this is the case for most people. As someone who's done a lot of copyediting in publishing, marking things up with little heiroglyphs feels familiar.
- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
Right now it's been easy becuause I'm still getting my feet wet in HTML basics. I like to draw in black and white, ink drawings. Once you add color it's a whole other ball game, and I'm glad to keep it stripped down before pouring the gunk in.
- What seems good and bad about HTML?
I don't feel experienced enough to say. It's definitely simpler to wrap my head around, but that might be a positive/negative. I think it does a great job of outlining things, knowing what's the most important element, second-tier, etc. Nifty ways to divide text, and helps you thinks about structure on a simple but effective word-level.
- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
The verb "wrap" is key. In the Geico image for example you need to wrap the image inside the <p></p>, else your image is sitting there in space. Wrapping holds stuff you want together, together.
